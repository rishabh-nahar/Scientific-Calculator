# Scientific Calculator (Java Swing)

This is a Java Swing-based Scientific Calculator that allows users to perform various scientific calculations. The calculator provides a user-friendly graphical interface to interact with the mathematical functionalities it offers.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Advanced mathematical functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, etc.)
- Parentheses support for complex expressions
- Clearing functionalities (AC, C)
- Decimal and integer number support
- Error handling for invalid expressions

## Getting Started

To use the Scientific Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, Visual Studio, etc.).
3. Locate the main class that contains the `main` method (usually named something like `CalculatorMain` or `Main`) and run the application.

## Usage

1. Launch the application, and the calculator GUI will appear.
2. Use the mouse or keyboard to interact with the calculator buttons.
3. The calculator supports both button-click and keyboard-input for convenience.

### Button Usage

- Numeric Buttons: Click on these buttons to input the desired numbers for calculations.
- Operator Buttons: Use these buttons to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Function Buttons: These buttons enable various mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithm, etc.).
- Parentheses Buttons: Use these buttons to group and evaluate complex expressions.
- Clear Buttons: AC clears the current entry, and C clears the entire expression.

## Notes

- The calculator provides real-time validation for expressions and displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or calculations.
- The calculator is designed for standard mathematical expressions and may not support all complex scientific notations.
- For trigonometric functions, the calculator uses radians by default.

## Credits

The Scientific Calculator was developed using Java Swing by Rishabh Nahar, Aditya Trivedi, Jayesh Wadhe and Anuj Urunkar which is inspired by various online tutorials and resources.
